Our research interests are varied and aim to address some of the below areas of interest. As our brains change throughout our life and are impacted by everything thing we do we are looking at targeted areas of the brain to further understand what impacts us and how to enhance our cognition as we go through these ages and stages. Our current research projects aim to address some of the below questions: 

1. Mindfullness and meditation 

2. Long term potentiation and familiarity in the ageing brain 

3. The neural dynamics of cognitive control: Theta-range neural oscillations and Frontal Executive Function

4. Functional and structural brain organization of children with auditory processing disorder

We address these questions using a variety of mathematical and statistical tools as well as conducting experiments. We have current projects focused on network systems, and population dynamics. We are always open to collaborate with other researchers on a variety of topics.

**The Neural Dynamics of Cognitive Control: Theta-range Neural Oscillations and Frontal Executive Function**
 
Professor Ian Kirk in collaboration with Dr. Christopher Erb, Dr. Meg Spriggs, and Professor Olav Krigolson
 
Cognitive control refers to the neuro-mechanisms of self control (resisting impulsively or distraction). Cognitive control is required in language and memory functions, for decision making, and for cognitive flexibility. Although the areas of the brain involved in cognitive control are well studied, we know relatively little of how interactions between different brain areas dynamically change within and between tasks. Our aim here is to record electrical neuroactivity in specific brain circuits during cognitive control tasks to gain a better understanding of the dynamic interactions between brain areas during tasks requiring cognitive control. In addition, using structural brain imaging, we will map this activity onto the structural brain networks involved. This work will provide a much more detailed picture of how cognitive control is instantiated in the brain. More broadly, this work will allow for future investigation into how individual differences might arise during development, during ageing, or in psychological or neurological disorders.


Here are just a few images from our cameras so far. More photos, and also videos, will be posted soon!
