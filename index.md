# research into neural networks underlying memory and learning


The M.I.N.D Lab at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html) utilises experimental, mathematical, and statistical tools to understand the neural activities that underlie behaviour. We investigate neural systems subserving memory, attention, and cognitive control. We have particular interest in neural oscillations, plasticity, and network dynamics utilising EEG and MRI (fMRI and DWI). 

Current themes include:

1. A broadscale project to understand relationships between different cognitive control and working memory
2. Investigating structural and functional networks (connectomics)
3. Understanding the ageing brain and Alzheimer's disease
4. The relationship between EEG osciallatory phenomena and behaviour
5. Signatures of human neural plasticity
