# research into neural networks underlying memory and learning


The M.I.N.D Lab at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html) is a team of scientists combining experiments with mathematical and statistical tools to address the neuronal changes our brains go through on a regular basis. We address questions related to ageing populations as well as children, effects of caffeine on the brain, and network connectivity in several states. A common thread throughout our work is the role of neural variability. We are currently conducting research into The Neural Dynamics of Cognitive Control: Theta-range Neural Oscillations and Frontal Executive Function.
