We are a diverse research group working in the School of Psychology at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Our goal is to shed light on the neural systems and dynamics that underly memory and neuroplasticity, and the impacts on of neuropsychological conditions/neuropathologies. 
We employ functional and structural imaging, such as electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), to investigate the temporal and spatial neurodynamics and anatomical substrates of cognition. We work alongside the Dementia Prevention Research Clinic (DPRC) to further our understanding of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease, engaging with the people affected by dementia, collecting data, and contributing analytic expertise. Our research interests also include auditory processing, cognitive enhancement.
