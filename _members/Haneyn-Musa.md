Katherine M. Pag√°n Rivera (she/her/hers) is in her last year at the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao where she is majoring in coastal marine biology and wildlife management. Her main area of interest is ecology, especially in estuarine systems and the great variety of factors that can influence and alter them. In addition to this, she has a special interest in aquatic invertebrates. Among some of her most recent research roles, she worked with deep sea image analysis to obtain the biomass of benthic macroinvertebrates in the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone in the Pacific Ocean. After obtaining her bachelor's she plans to continue graduate education related to estuarine ecosystems. Also, she is works with local hands-on volunteer efforts such as coast monitoring for sea turtles nesting. In her free time, you can find her diving, snorkeling, or even skating.
