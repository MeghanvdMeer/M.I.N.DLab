Hayat graduated from the University of Otago with a Bachelor of Science in neuroscience and went on to complete her Honour's degree in psychology at the University of Auckland. During her Honour's year Hayat began investigating changes in white matter in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and controls.
Currently, Hayat is a PhD student in the School of Psychology at the University of Auckland. Hayat has delved deeper into the research she completed in her honours year; her interests have shifted from a purely voxel-based approach to using fixel-based analysis techniques in order to examine ascending synchronized brain systems. She is using diffusion weighted imaging data collected from the Dementia Prevention Research Clinic (DPRC). Her work is being conducted under the supervision of Prof Ian Kirk, Prof Lynette Tippett and Prof Reece Roberts.
