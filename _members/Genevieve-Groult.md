Genevieve is studying a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery with the School of Medicine, University of Auckland, New Zealand in 2023. Previously, she completed a Bachelor of Health Science through Auckland University of Technology, before returning to the University of Auckland to complete a Postgraduate Diploma in Science and a Masterâ€™s Degree in Science, Neuroscience. During her Masters, Genevieve worked alongside Professor Kirk, Associate Professor Tippett and Ashkan Alvand within the School of Psychology to explore the relationships between functional neural networks of the brain and performance in memory tests across a population of individuals with either normal cognitive function (HC), or mild cognitive impairment (MCI: amnestic or multi-domain). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was employed to obtain 116 regions of interest (ROIs) across functional neural networks of the brain. Analysis of various metrics such as the degree of connectivity between ROIs through graph theoretical analysis, and correlation to performance in memory tests assessing various cognitive domains was conducted for both individual participants across the study, and between groups for both the HC and MCI populations. The research findings demonstrated how analysis between diagnostic imaging techniques such as fMRI and memory test performance data may provide an indication of functional neural network activation across populations, and how changes in functional activation of these networks can change with relations to decreased memory test performance in patients with mild cognitive impairment.

Through this research, Genevieve developed a deep appreciation of how such research may provide researchers and clinicians alike with tools to assess areas of declined cognitive function in patients, and thus potentially targetable areas for rehabilitation.
