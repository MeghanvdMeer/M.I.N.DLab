I am a current undergraduate at UNH majored in zoology with a minor in marine biology. I am an alumni of Shoals Marine Laboratory and have involved myself in experiences including zoo volunteering, co-running the Zoological Society club, and becoming certified in open water Scuba diving. I am very passionate about involvement in my field and look forward to the future ahead!
