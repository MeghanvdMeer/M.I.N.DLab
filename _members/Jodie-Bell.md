My name is Jodie Bell and I am a PhD candidate working in the field of cognitive neuroscience. I conduct EEG-based research on the neurocognitive processes involved in the practice of mindfulness meditation, with a particular focus on attention, working memory and cognitive control. In my spare time I love doing yoga and am a qualified yoga instructor.
