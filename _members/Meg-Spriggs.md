During her psychology undergraduate at the University of Otago everything changed. Meg was introduced to EEG (electroencephalography) and fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). After finishing her BA at Otago, Meg joined Prof Ian Kirk’s lab at the University of Auckland for a couple of summer placements and her Honours degree. For her PhD project, Meg looked at electrophysiological markers of neural plasticity (the brain’s ability to adapt) that differentiate healthy ageing from mild cognitive impairment (a condition that causes cognitive changes and increases the risk of developing dementia). While she is excited to follow the progress of the DPRC, for now her own path has taken her elsewhere. Meg currently works as a postdoc in the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London. She is investigating psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, and how it can be used in the treatment of mental health. Meg is leading a new trial looking at psilocybin assisted therapy for anorexia nervosa. She is also assisting with another trial looking at the psychological and brain effects of psilocybin in healthy volunteers. She is particularly excited about the opportunity this field offers for a new approach to mental health treatment.
