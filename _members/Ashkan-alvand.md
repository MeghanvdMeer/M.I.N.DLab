Ashkan is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Univeristy of Auckland. He completed his Ph.D. at the School of Psychology, University of Auckland, New Zealand in 2023. Previously, he completed a bachelor's in Information Technology through the University of Mazandaran (2014) and then received his Master's degree in Computer Networking at Azad University (2016) in Iran. During his Master's program, he became familiar with graph theory in biological systems and developed a strong interest in this approach. His passion for understanding brain networks and their behaviour led him to continue his studies in network neuroscience.

Ashkan's doctoral research focused on studying brain functional and structural organization of children with Auditory Processing Disorder using resting-state functional MRI and diffusion MRI techniques.
