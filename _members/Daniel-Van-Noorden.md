I recently graduated with a BSc(Hons) in Psychology from the University of Auckland. Previously I completed a Graduate Diploma in Psychology at Massey University and a BA(Hons) in Philosophy at the University of Auckland. My main area of interest is cognitive neuroscience, and how it relates to other fields of scientific inquiry such as information theory, physics, AI, and evolution.

My current research project focuses on neural oscillatory signatures of predictive coding in language processing. Recent developments in Large Language Models and EEG analysis have brought AI and neuroscience closer together than ever before.  Illuminating the relationship between biological and computational linguistic processing will help us build better AI programs and understand more about what it means to be human.
