Diya completed her undergraduate degree in the M.I.N.D Lab in 2021. Her research project looked at the global white matter differences and specific white matter structures like the uncinate fasciculus, cingulum angular bundle, cingulate gyrus and the fornix, between Val/Val BDNF carriers and the Met allele carriers, using DWI.
