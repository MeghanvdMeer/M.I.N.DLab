Meghan is a PhD candidate in the School of Psychology at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. She previously completed an MSc in Psychology in [Trinity College Dublin] (https://www.tcd.ie/), Ireland. During her Master’s programme she investigated extreme stress and false memory recall in the general population. This research was linked to why torture does not work by [Prof Shane O’Mara] (https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=smomara) and [Prof Aine Kelly] (https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=aikelly). 
Meghan’s doctoral research focuses on the ageing brain with Prof Ian Kirk and Prof Lynette Tippett. She is looking at diffusion MRI and electroencephalogram (EEG) techniques linked to brain ageing specifically in Mild Cognitive Impairment (a prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s Disease). She works with the [Dementia Prevention Research Clinic (DPRC)] (https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/fmhs/research/cbr/clinics/dprc.html) assisting with participants and MRI scans. She is also the lab manager of the M.I.N.D Lab.
