Dylan Taylor was a Master's student in the lab. He was using diffusion imaging to look at how the white matter in the brain changes due to aging or disease. To do this he used graph theoretic measures to look at network “connectivity” in a collection of ways, the current focus being on the development of an analysis with flow graphs, particularly, maximum flow.
