Dylan Taylor is currently a PhD student within the Kirk Lab, he began his PhD in 2023. He completed his Master's degree in 2022. He was using diffusion imaging to look at how the white matter in the brain changes due to aging or disease. To do this he used graph theoretic measures to look at network “connectivity” in a collection of ways, the current focus being on the development of an analysis with flow graphs, particularly, maximum flow.
