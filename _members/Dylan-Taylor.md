Dylan grew up in Whangārei leaving to attempt to join the circus. After a brief stint doing professional dance training, he ended up at the University of Auckland studying mathematics, theoretical computer science and psychology. His honour’s and Master’s research looked at white matter structures using diffusion MRI, where he discovered network neuroscience. After completing his Master’s in 2022, he went on to start a PhD trying to combine network science, information science and ideas from complex systems, to the study of cognitive control. He enjoys collaborative projects where people can bring different views onto the same problem.
