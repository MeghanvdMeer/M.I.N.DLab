Rohan is a research fellow in the M.I.N.D. Lab. He realised his PhD in Psychology at the University of Auckland, as well as degrees in music and mathematics. He has worked on a range of projects investigating brain function in healthy populations and related to health conditions.

He is interested in neural circuitry and signalling, complexity in the brain, neural plasticity, memory (especially working memory), cognitive control and decision-making, cognitive enhancement, neuroimaging analysis, mathematics, music, and experiencing existing (when heâ€™s non-numeric).

His research looks at neural oscillations and circuits related to cognitive control and working memory, the effects of cognitive enhancing agents such as caffeine upon neural plasticity and working memory, and the complexity of neural activity in different states.
