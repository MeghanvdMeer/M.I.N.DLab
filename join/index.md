# <i class="fas join"></i>Join the Lab


All lab members must:
- Have an interest in psychology/neural systems 
- Want to change the world


## Undergraduate and Graduate students

The lab often has openings for undergraduate and graduate students at UoA to contribute to projects or design a project for a thesis/research experience. These can be paid or count as course credits. These projects are typically co-designed by the student, graduate students, and Professor Ian Kirk. The students most likely to be accepted for a position are those with a keen interest in developing skills in the context of neuroscience research. If you are interested, please send <i.kirk@auckland.ac.nz> a CV and brief introduction, including details of your prior research experience, as well as your research interests and goals and how you think these align with my research program.


## PhD Candidates

The lab often has openings for PhD students. I am also open to collaboratively working on proposals to help fund independent PhD positions through several different programs.

Further information for doctoral candidates can be found [here](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/academic-information/postgraduate-students/doctoral.html). 


If you are interested, please send an email and CV to Ian Kirk (<i.kirk@auckland.ac.nz>). 

Unfortunately, we do not have any Postdoctoral fellowships but we are open to prospective students
