On the 20th October, Haneyn and Hayat presented posters for their Honours thesis to the Faculty of Psychology. Haneyn's topic is "Frontal Midline Theta activity and memory scanning during the sternberg task". 
Hayat's topic is "white matter tracts in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls". 
They both did very well and we would like to congratulate Hayat and Haneyn on their wonderful posters and presentations.
