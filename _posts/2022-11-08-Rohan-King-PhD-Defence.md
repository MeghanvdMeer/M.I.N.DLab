In November 2022 we celebrated the successful PhD defence of one of our PhD Candidates, Rohan King. Rohan's PhD focused on the modulation of neural plasticity, memory and complexity of brain activity by caffeine and a juice blend of bioactive plant extracts. His thesis is currently under examination and we wish him all the best and cannot wait to see all the wonderful research he puts out in the future. 

Below is an image from Rohan's PhD thesis. It illsutares memory recall-related parietal power difference of acute 𝑗𝑢𝑖𝑐𝑒 − acute placebo (with time in ms, frequency in Hz at 0.3-0.7 Hz resolution, and power difference in dB coloured according to the colour bar)

We wish Dr. King everything of the best in his future and cannot wait to see what he does next.
