In 2022 we celebrated the Marsden grant funding awarded to Professor Ian Kirk. Prof Kirk will be collaborating with Dr. Christopher Erb, Dr. Meg Spriggs and Professor Olav Krigolson along with several memebers of our lab.
The aim is to address neural dynamics in cognitive control looking at Theta-range oscialltions and frontal executive function. More can be found on our [Research page](https://meghanvdmeer.github.io/M.I.N.DLab/research/).
