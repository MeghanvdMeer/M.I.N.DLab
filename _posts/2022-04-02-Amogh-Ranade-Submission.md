In May 2022, we celebrated the Master's thesis submission of Amogh Ranade. Amogh looked at functional network connectivity using fMRI. He worked with our PhD student, Ashkan Alvand.   
We would like to congratulate Amogh on all his hard work and we wish him everything of the best for his future endeavours.
