In June we celebrated the Master's submission of Dylan Taylor. He looked at network connectivity in Alzheimer's Disease. We wish Dylan the very best in this stressful process and cannot wait to see what he does in his future!

Easton will be [teaching both introductory biology (BIOL 412) for undergraduates and a new Data Science with R course](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/teaching/) for graduate students.

Fingers crossed for a healthy and safe Fall semester given we are still battling COVID-19!
