In June 2022, we celebrated the Master's thesis submission of Dylan Taylor. He was using diffusion imaging to look at how the white matter in the brain changes due to aging or disease. He used graph theoretic measures to look at network “connectivity” in a collection of ways, the current focus being on the development of an analysis with flow graphs, particularly, maximum flow.

We would like to congratulate Dylan on all his hard work and we wish him everything of the best for his future endeavours.
