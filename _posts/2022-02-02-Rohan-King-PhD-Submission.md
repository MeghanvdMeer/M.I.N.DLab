In February 2022 we celebrated the submission of one of our PhD Candidates, Rohan King. Rohan's PhD focused on the modulation of neural plasticity, memory and complexity of brain activity by caffeine and a juice blend of bioactive plant extracts. His thesis is currently under examination and we wish him all the best and cannot wait to see all the wonderful research he puts out in the future.
