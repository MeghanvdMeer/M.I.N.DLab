As a lab we are continually updating our skills and training in a variety of neuro-imaging techniques. Below are some that we currently use or are currently training to use in the future. 


{% include section.html %}


## Systems we currently use
We employ a variety of neurological imaging techniques such as Brain Products ActiCap Slim EEG 64 channel, EGI EEG system, MRI and fMRI. We hope to further our research into M.E.G (Magnetoencephalography) and TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) techniques.

## EGI EEG System: 
EGI EEG system is a net-based system pictured below. It uses HydroCel electrodes on a geodesic sensor net. We currently have the 128 channel net for heads sized for infants (42-43cm, 44-47cm, 47-51cm) and adults (55-58cm). More information can be found [here](https://www.egi.com/research-division/eeg-systems/geodesic-eeg-systems). 

## Brain Products EEG System:
Brain Products EEG acticap is a cap based system pictured below right. It uses active electrodes. We currently have 64 channels net for adults (55-62cm). More information on brain products can be found [here](https://www.brainproducts.com/). 

## MRI Scanner: 
MRI studies are run at CAMRI (Centre for advanced MRI) at The University of Auckland. CAMRI uses the 3T Siemens Skyra. The Skyra is the first 3T Tim (Total Imaging Matrix) + DOT system (Day Optimising Throughput). More can be found [here](https://camri.auckland.ac.nz).
